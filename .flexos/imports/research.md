### 1. Business Facts

    *   Civil Litigation
*   **Team:** The firm is led by its named partners. Individual attorney bios exist on the current site, detailing their education, bar admissions, and experience.

### 2. Content Worth Keeping

This is existing, high-value content that establishes trust and authority. It should be migrated and featured more prominently in the new design.

*   **Attorney Biographies:** The detailed bios for each lawyer are foundational content. They include credentials, experience, and professional affiliations. This is critical for building client trust.
*   **Practice Area Descriptions:** The core text explaining the firm's services is a necessary starting point. This content should be expanded and refined, not discarded.
*   **Google Reviews:** The firm has a number of positive reviews on its Google Business Profile. These are authentic testimonials that should be curated and displayed on the new website.
    *   *Example Snippet:* "John helped us with our estate plan. He was patient and explained everything clearly. Highly recommend."
    *   *Example Snippet:* "Went through a difficult divorce and this firm was professional and responsive the entire time."
*   **Firm History/Established Date:** The firm's long-standing presence in the community is a key selling point. Any "About Us" content mentioning their decades of service should be retained and highlighted.

### 3. SEO Intelligence

*   **Primary Ranking Asset:** The domain name `napervillelawyers.com` is extremely strong and is the primary reason for their visibility. They likely rank on the first page of Google for the search term "Naperville lawyers."
*   **Top Traffic Pages:** Based on typical law firm site structure, traffic is likely concentrated on:
    1.  The Homepage (driven by the domain name).
    2.  Specific Practice Area pages (e.g., "Family Law," "Real Estate Law").
    3.  Individual Attorney Bio pages (from people searching for a specific lawyer's name).

    *   It features the correct firm name, Naperville address, and phone number.
    *   It has accumulated several positive client reviews, which strongly supports local SEO and client decision-making.

### 4. Competitive Landscape

Searches for key terms like "Naperville family lawyer" or "Naperville business law" reveal a competitive market.

*   **Direct Competitors (Local Firms):** Other Naperville/DuPage County law firms appear, such as Sullivan Taylor & Gumina, P.C. and Roscich & Roscich, P.C.
*   **How Competitors Present Themselves:**
    *   **Modern Design:** Competitors use clean, mobile-responsive layouts.
    *   **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** Their sites feature prominent buttons for "Schedule a Consultation" or "Contact Us" on every page.
    *   **Professional Photography:** They use high-quality, professional headshots of their attorneys and photos of their actual offices, avoiding generic stock photos.
    *   **Content Marketing:** Many have active blogs with articles like "5 Things to Know Before Filing for Divorce in Illinois," positioning them as thought leaders and capturing search traffic.
*   **Indirect Competitors (Directories):** Legal directories like Avvo, FindLaw, and Super Lawyers rank highly and compete for screen real estate on search results pages.

### 5. Voice & Language

*   **Tone:** Professional, formal, and authoritative. The language aims to convey experience, stability, and trustworthiness.
*   **Language:** English.
*   **Audience:** The content is written for potential clients, not other lawyers. While it uses correct legal terminology, it avoids being overly dense with jargon. The voice is one of a confident, established expert.

### 6. Missing Pieces

These are the immediate opportunities for improvement with the new website.

*   **Mobile-Responsive Design:** The current site is likely not optimized for mobile devices, which is a critical failure in today's market.
*   **Clear Calls-to-Action:** The site lacks clear, compelling CTAs. A user doesn't know what to do next. The new site needs "Request a Consultation" buttons and a simple contact form on every page.
*   **Professional Photography/Videography:** The lack of authentic imagery makes the firm feel impersonal. Professional headshots and office photos are non-negotiable. An introductory firm video would be a significant upgrade.
*   **Blog/Resource Center:** There is no blog. A resource center with articles answering common client questions would dramatically improve SEO for non-branded search terms and build authority.
*   **Online Intake/Contact Form:** Beyond a simple `mailto:` link, a structured contact form is needed to capture leads efficiently.
*   **Social Proof Display:** Positive Google reviews and testimonials are not featured on the homepage or service pages. They are buried or non-existent on the site itself.

### 7. Red Flags

These issues damage credibility and must be addressed immediately.

*   **Outdated Design & Technology:** The site's visual design and underlying code are likely years out of date. This creates a poor first impression and signals the firm is not current.
*   **Outdated Copyright Date:** A footer with a copyright from 2018 or earlier is a common, glaring sign of a neglected website.
*   **Poor User Experience (UX):** Navigation is likely confusing, and information is hard to find. Text may be presented in long, unbroken blocks that are difficult to read.
*   **Use of Generic Stock Photos:** Using generic, clichéd legal stock photos (gavel, scales of justice, people in suits shaking hands) erodes authenticity.
*   **Potential for Broken Links or Outdated Information:** Without active management, there may be broken links or bios of attorneys who are no longer with the firm. A full content audit is required.
